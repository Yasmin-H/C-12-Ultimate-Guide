Whilst .NET Framework was released when .NET was released which was in 2002
.NET Core was released in 2016

It is ideal for cross-platform developments, which supports various operating 
systems like Windows, Linuc and Mac

 and hardware devices which includes desktop , web and mobile


In fact, .NET Framework doesn't support other than windows so we cannot run them in macs 
so .NET Core fills that gap 

it has versions up to 3.1 

Recently, Microsoft has upgraded / renamed .NET core as .NET after .NET Core 3.1
So in the future there will be no updates to .NET Core
.NET is the future of .net platform 

.NET Core is used in Xamarin and ASP.NET Core 

Xamarin -> development of mobile applications for Android, iOS and Windows 

ASP.NET core -> development of web applications that can run on windows , linux and Mac 


.NET Core is open-sourced 

Contains the class library, but only of which is necessary for .NET Core
It wouldn't contain any predefined libraries that are specific to windows for example

.NET Core supports mainly two languages : C# and VB.NET
