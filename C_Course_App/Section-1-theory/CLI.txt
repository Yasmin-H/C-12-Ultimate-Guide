CLI (Common Language Infrastructure)
How is the .NET application compiled ? 

--------------------------------------------------------------

Application source code written in C# cannot be executed by the hardware directly.
Needs to be converted to native machine code 
Works in 2 stops : 

1- Application Source Code -> Intermediate Language ( IL)

ensures whatever language written in the application source code such as C# or VB.NET are all executed in a common way
( turned into a single language called IL)

2. CLR -> Native Machine Code

Common Language Runtime ( CLR) is the execution engine for all .NET programs. Converts IL to Native Machine Code
Also does other things like Thread Management, Exception Management, Class Loading and Garbage Collection.
