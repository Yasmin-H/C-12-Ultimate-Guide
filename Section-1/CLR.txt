CLR (Common Language Runtime)
What is CLR and its features

------------------------------------------------------

it's the execution engine for all .NET languages

It is the code-execution enviroment for all types of .NET applications like console, web etc...

Converts IL to Native Machine Code

CLR provides several runtime services which are essential such as : 

1. Class Loader
2. Memory Manager
3. Garbage Collector
4. JIT Compiler 
5. Exception Manager
6. Thread Manager
7. Security Manager

How it works : 

- It loads the class if necessary ( if in code a class is used then need access ) from compiled source code to memory 
- Then Memory Manager allocates the necessary memeory for objects ( when var are created or objects incl parameters)
- Garbage Collector then deletes the memory ( frees memory) after usage 
- Just-In-Time(JIT) Compiler then converts the IL code into Native Machine Language in order to execute the code by hardware
- Exception Manager will catch all exceptions that are raised during the execution of the application 
- Thread Manager is responsible to create , run and stop the threads **

** Thread is an object in .NET that is responsible to execute the code. By default, every application contains a thread called Main thread 
and you may create multiple threads based on main thread and thus you will make the application multi-threaded. So whenver you want to 
execute multiple individual processes simultaneously, then you will use the threads and all those threads will be executed by thread manager.

- And lastly, Security Manager verifies whether the application has permission to access system resources or not.
