Understanding .NET Framework

-----------------------------------

.NET Framework is a software platform to build different types of applications such as desktops, windows and web applications.

.NET has 2 major components : 

1. .NET Framework
2. .NET Core 


.NET Framework mainly consists of 2 major components : 

1. CLR (the execution engine for all applications)
2. FCL ( Framework Class Library) ** 


** Contains the complete library available in .NET. That means all the predefined classess, structures , interfaces that are 
available in .NET Framework


The .NET Framework Architecture shows the collection of all components and languages that are available in .NET framework 
- we have more than 30 languages available in .NET but C# is the most common
- All those languages are developed based on the CLS ( Common Language Specification) - a Specification on all those languages
- And the CLS is developed based on the predefined libraries which is 
     - Win Forms
     - ASP.NET
     - WPF
     - Others
- And all those libraries are developled based on ADO.NET which is used for database connections 
- ADO.NET is based on the Base Class Library (BCL)
- And the Base Class Library is based on the Commn Language Runtime 


all those predfined libraries like Win Forms, ADO.NET and BCL all form FCL (Framework Class Library)


...........................................................................................................



BCL  :

   - contains a set of predefined classes that can be used in all types of .NET applications to perform general 
   i/o operations, type conversion, creation of threads etc..

these include console. string, convert, task ,thread etc...

   
this is different from FCL that includes libraries specific to windows or console or web. Whereas BCL is a general one. 
so in short FCL = BCL + specific libraires


ADO.NET :

      - contains a set of predfined classes that can also be used in all types of .NET applications for connecting to databases, 
         retrieving data from databases and doing CRUD operations 

these include SQLConnection, SQLCommand, SQLDataAdapter 


Win Forms : 
       - contains a set of predefined classes used specificically for windows for development of GUI elements such as 
         form , textbox, button, checkbox etc.. 


WPF : 
      - the advanced version of the one above 


ASP.NET : 

      - Contains a set of predefined classes that can be used in Web Applications for development of GUI elements such as 
        page, textbox, button, checkbox, radio buttion etc..
    
    * basiclaly same as Win Forms or WPF but for Web 
    And ASP.NET has subcomponents such as 
    -> ASP.Net Web Forms
    -> ASP.NET Web Pages
    -> ASP.NET MVC
    -> ASP.NET Web API etc..
